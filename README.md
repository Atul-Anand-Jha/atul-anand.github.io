## 🔄 Bucket List Management

The bucket list progress is managed through code updates for security and simplicity:

1. **Update Progress**: Edit the `completedItems` array in `src/components/BucketListContainer.tsx`
2. **Commit Changes**: Push to the main branch
3. **Auto-Deploy**: GitHub Actions automatically rebuilds and deploys

```typescript
// Example: Mark items as complete
const completedItems = [1, 15, 31, 47, 66, 77, 78, 79, 81, 92]
```
