# Bucket List Progress Management

## Overview
The bucket list is read-only for visitors. Progress is managed by editing the code and redeploying the site.

## How to Update Progress

### 1. Edit the Completed Items Array
Navigate to `/src/components/BucketListContainer.tsx` and find this line (around line 11):

```typescript
const completedItems = [1, 15, 31, 47, 66, 77, 78, 79, 81] // Example completed items
```

### 2. Add or Remove Item IDs
To mark items as complete, add their ID numbers to the array:

```typescript
// Example: Marking items 1, 15, 31, 47, 66, 77, 78, 79, 81, 92 as complete
const completedItems = [1, 15, 31, 47, 66, 77, 78, 79, 81, 92]
```

To unmark items, remove their ID numbers from the array.

### 3. Deploy the Changes
After updating the array:

1. Save the file
2. Build and deploy the site:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```
   Or deploy to your hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

## Item Reference
You can find all bucket list items with their IDs in `/src/data/bucketListData.ts`. Each item has:
- `id`: Unique identifier (1-100)
- `title`: The bucket list item name
- `description`: Detailed description
- `category`: travel, career, personal, adventure, or learning
- `difficulty`: 1-5 star rating

## Benefits of This Approach
- **Simple**: No admin panel or backend required
- **Secure**: Only the site owner can update progress
- **Reliable**: Progress is version-controlled with the code
- **Fast**: No database queries or API calls needed
- **Transparent**: All changes are tracked in git history
